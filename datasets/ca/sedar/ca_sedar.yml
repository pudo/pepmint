  The Disciplined List contains the names of individuals and organizations disciplined

  implemented a statutory reciprocal order provision.

    The CSA is modernizing the electronic filing and data access systems that underpin 
    Canadian securities regulation. SEDAR+ is the new, secure web-based system used by 
    all market participants to file, disclose and search for information in Canada’s 
    capital markets.

    On July 25, 2023, SEDAR+ consolidated and replaced 
    - **SEDAR** (System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval)
    - The national **Cease Trade Order (CTO)** database, 
    - The **Disciplined List (DL)** database and certain filings currently made 
       in paper or in the British Columbia Securities Commission’s eServices system
    - The **Ontario Securities Commission’s** electronic filing portal.
  
    SEDAR+ also includes a consolidated reporting issuers list from all provincial and 
    territorial regulators.
